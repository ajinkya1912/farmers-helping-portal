PROPOSED SYSTEM


 

“Always live in reality, not in imagination.”




This chapter gives you an idea about the project which I have undertaken. It explains the user requirements of the system to be developed leading to proposing a solution for the same from our side.  User requirements we get from our users so it’s totally based on there’s need.
________________________________________

	Proposed System
	Objectives of System
	User Requirements
	Feasibility Study

 
2.1 Proposed system
________________________________________

  This website provides facility to conduct online.
 It saves time as it allows number of user to give at a time and displays the results as the test gets over, so no need to wait for the result. It is automatically generated by the server.  Administrator has a privilege to create, modify and delete the test papers and its particular questions. User can register, login and give the test with his specific id, and can see the results as well. 

FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES:    The ultimate aim of this website is providing best and accurate information to the farmers. Gives them a better functionality and better fertilizers in less cost.

PERFORMANCE LEVEL:   The scope of this project gives immense opportunity for the farmers to know accurate information of their crops. It provides effective software so as to help the user.

DATA STRUCTURES:          The data in this project are maintained in the tabular form using MYSQL in the form of database. It provides easy access to the user.

SAFETY: No data loss occurs in the game system.
1.  It is open for all such a way that it gives permission to the all to access.
2.  The information about crops is accurate.
.
RELIABILITY:          We assure that the project is completely authenticated in order to enhance security and corruptions of database as well as the software.
 
2.2 Objective of system
________________________________________

	The main objective of the system to provide best quality information to farmers.
	To reduce paper work & time required to prepare a online work. 
	To reduce errors while calculating the Quantity & Amount.
	Save time for next trade.
	To provide accurate reports.
	Easy to maintain.
	Manual work is reduced.
 
2.3 User requirements
________________________________________
Requirements analysis in systems engineering and software engineering, encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users.
Requirements analysis is critical to the success of a development project. Requirements must be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design. Requirements can be architectural, structural, behavioral, functional, and non-functional.
The development of project needs some requirement to make the project perform better and achieves the goal of project. In developing Online game, the capabilities of computer and hardware plays a big impact on project quality. The project maker should determine the minimum requirements of hardware and also software to be used to develop a good and attractive project.
There are two phases of requirement analysis as given below 
1)	Primary Research: Identifying the user requirements conducting a survey based on a logicalize.
2)	Secondary Research: Comparing the indentified requirements with already existing software having similar functionalities. 
 
2.4 Feasibility Study
________________________________________

Technical Feasibility:-
As we know that technical feasibility centers on the existing computer system (hardware, software, etc.) and to what extent it can support the proposed addition. But in this case the situation is different. Here there is no existing system at all. Everything needs to be purchased. So each and every office should have the following for their infrastructure –

a)	Client/Server architecture.
b)	A good communication media based network.
a.	Various System and Application Software installed on the system.
c)	SQL Server 2005
a.	On Server there should be Windows NT/2000 as operating system.
d)	On clients Windows 9x/2000/XP running on them.
e)	Printers.

Thus, after fulfilling the above requirement the technical feasibility will hold for the Stock Monitoring System.

Technical 
User needs a web-based system, which will remove all the above-mentioned  Problems that, the user is facing. The user wants a web-based system, which will reduce the bulk of paperwork, provide ease of  work, flexibility, fast record finding, modifying, adding, removing and generating the reports.
This software will definitely reduce the delay in Buying and Selling of Stocks. The cost of the software is justifiable in context of this great achievement. So we can conclude that the economic feasibility holds for Scheme Monitoring System and in monetary terms allocating fund for the project is not a restriction for them 

BehavioralFeasibility:-
As we know that people are inherently resistant to change and computers have been known to facilitate change but in spite of these System is behaviorally feasible with its user and employees other than the users. On the introduction of new system.

Technology used

Html
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]


Php:
It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
It is deep enough to run the largest social network (Facebook)!
It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!
•	PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
•	PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language
•	PHP scripts are executed on the server
•	PHP is free to download and use
•	PHP can generate dynamic page content
•	PHP can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
•	PHP can collect form data
•	PHP can send and receive cookies
•	PHP can add, delete, modify data in your database
•	PHP can be used to control user-access
•	PHP can encrypt data

JavaScript:
JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.
This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
